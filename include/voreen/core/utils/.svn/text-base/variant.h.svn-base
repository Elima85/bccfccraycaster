/**
 * This class is a basic wrapper for many common types so that they can be handled uniformly. The variant always
 * contains one value of specific type which can be inspected by getType(). <br>
 * <h3>Native types</h3>
 * The Variant supports a number of native types which are:  boolean, double, float, integer, long, std::string
 * tgt::ivec2, tgt::ivec3, tgt::ivec4, tgt::vec2, tgt::vec3, tgt::vec4, tgt::dvec2, tgt::dvec3, tgt::dvec4,
 * tgt::mat2, tgt::mat3, tgt::mat4, tgt::Camera, tgt::ShaderSource, VolumeHandle, VolumeCollection.
 * All types except tgt::Camera, tgt::ShaderSource, VolumeHandle and VolumeCollection are stored as copies inside
 * the Variant. The other types only store a pointer to the object because they are considered non-trivial to
 * copy.<br>
 * All these types have their own access methods and constructors and basic conversions are implemented:<br>
 * <table>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td></td><td>Bool</td><td>Double</td><td>Float</td><td>Integer</td><td>Long</td><td>String</td><td>ivecX</td>
 *   <td>vecX</td><td>dvecX</td><td>matX</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>Bool</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>Double</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>Float</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>Integer</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>Long</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>String</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>ivecX</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>vecX</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>dvecX</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>matX</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td>
 *  </tr>
 * </table>
 * All other types cannot be converted into any other type.
 * 
 * <h3>User Types</h3>
 * User types are added to a variatn with the methods Variant::get<T> and Variant::set<T>. Please note that only the
 * pointer of a user type will be stored and that there is neither the possibility for serialization or performing a
 * Variant::deepCopy. Furthermore, no conversion is possible between user types.<br>
 * Every user type should have its own VariantType number, beginning from Variant::VariantTypeUserType counting upwards.
 * Using this, it is guaranteed that the Variant(const Variant&), canConvert(VariantType, VariantType) and
 * operator=(const Variant&) methods work properly.
